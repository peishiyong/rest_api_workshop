# Description

This is a simple codebase for making api call, for REST Api Workshop Nov 2019.

# Setup

The script should work with Ruby 2.0 and above.

```
bundle install # if failed, do `gem install bundler` and try again
bundle exec ruby example.rb

If all good, you should see 'hello world'. Get a :doughnut: to celebrate!
